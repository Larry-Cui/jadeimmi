## Definition and Interpretation

Being a spouse or common-law partner may grant immigration privileges under the family class. Section 117(1) of [IRPR](https://canlii.ca/t/56hld){:target=" \_blank"} states,

<p class="highlight yellow" markdown="1">A foreign national is a member of the family class if, with respect to a sponsor, the foreign national is the sponsor’s spouse, common-law partner or conjugal partner.</p>

A spousal relationship can be established with evidence such as a marriage registration certificate. A common-law partnership, however, has a distinct definition under Canadian immigration law.

Section 1(1) of [IRPR](https://canlii.ca/t/56hld){:target=" \_blank"} provides,

<p class="highlight yellow" markdown="1">**common-law partner** means, in relation to a person, an individual who is **cohabiting** with the person in a conjugal relationship, having so cohabited for a period of at least **one year**.</p>

In some cases, it may be impossible for two partners to live together—for example, in countries where same-sex relationships are discriminated against or even prohibited by law. Section 1(2) of [IRPR](https://canlii.ca/t/56hld){:target=" \_blank"} creates an exception for such situations:

<p class="highlight yellow" markdown="1">For the purposes of the Act and these Regulations, an individual who has been **in a conjugal relationship with a person for at least one year** but is **unable to cohabit** with the person, due to persecution or any form of penal control, shall be considered a common-law partner of the person.</p>

Partners in this type of relationship are referred to as conjugal partners. As set out in section 2 of the [IRPR](https://canlii.ca/t/56hld){:target=" \_blank"}, which means "in relation to a sponsor, a foreign national **residing outside Canada** who is in a conjugal relationship with the sponsor and has been in that relationship for a period of at least one year."

## Exclusions

Section 4 provides that “a foreign national **shall not** be considered a spouse, a common-law partner or a conjugal partner of a person,” if the marriage or relationship:

!!! failure "**(a)** was entered into primarily for the purpose of acquiring any status or privilege under the Act; or"

!!! failure "**(b)** is not genuine."

This provision establishes the legal test for the genuineness of a marriage or relationship. In addition, the [IRPR](https://canlii.ca/t/56hld){:target=" \_blank"} sets out other circumstances where a relationship will not qualify as a family-class/spouse in Canada relationship, under sections 117(9) and/or 125(1).

!!! failure "the foreign national is the sponsor’s conjugal partner and is under 18 years of age"

!!! failure "the foreign national is the sponsor’s spouse, common-law partner or conjugal partner, ==the sponsor has an existing sponsorship undertaking== in respect of a spouse, common-law partner or conjugal partner and the period referred to in subsection 132(1) in respect of that undertaking has not ended"

!!! failure "the foreign national is the sponsor’s spouse and"

    (i) the sponsor or the foreign national **was, at the time of their marriage, the spouse of another person**, or

    (ii) the sponsor has **lived separate and apart** from the foreign national **for at least one year** ==and==

      - **the sponsor is the common-law partner** of another person or the sponsor has a conjugal partner, or

      - **the foreign national is the common-law** partner of another person or the conjugal partner of another sponsor; or </p>

!!! failure "the foreign national is the sponsor’s spouse, and"

    if at the time the **marriage ceremony** was conducted either one or both of the spouses were **not physically present** unless the foreign national was marrying a person who was not physically present at the ceremony as a result of their service as a member of the Canadian Forces and the marriage is valid both under the laws of the jurisdiction where it took place and under Canadian law"

!!! failure "subject to subsection (10), the sponsor previously made an application for permanent residence and became a permanent resident, and"

    at the time of that application, the foreign national was a non-accompanying family member of the sponsor and **was not examined**.

Sections 130 - 133 address the eligibility requirements for sponsors. Among these, the five-year bar is particularly notable.

!!! failure "5-year bar"

    A sponsor who became a permanent resident or a Canadian citizen after being sponsored as a spouse, common-law partner or conjugal partner under subsection 13(1) of the Act may not sponsor a foreign national referred to in subsection (1) as a spouse, common-law partner or conjugal partner, unless the sponsor has been a permanent resident, or a Canadian citizen, or a combination of the two, for a period of at least **five years** immediately preceding the day on which a sponsorship application referred to in paragraph (1)(c) is filed by the sponsor in respect of the foreign national.
